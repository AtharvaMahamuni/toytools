## [alpha-v4.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Money & Finance category with the first five tools: Compound Interest, Rule of 72, Inflation, Savings Goal, and Emergency Fund calculators.
- Finance Engine (`src/lib/engines/finance/`) — a never-throwing, registry-driven calculation engine exposed as `ToyTools.runFinance`.
- Reusable, engine-agnostic platform layers that finance is the first consumer of:
  - Smart Input system (`src/components/inputs/`, `src/lib/inputs/`) with natural-number parsing, adaptive stepping, grouped/compact formatting, presets, and full keyboard/touch accessibility.
  - Interactive-result + visualization contracts (`src/lib/results/`, `src/lib/visualization/`).
  - Experience layer (`src/components/experience/`) — `ExperienceRenderer` with a config-driven section layout, capability flags, progressive disclosure, and UI-state contract.
  - Concept and worked-example registries (`src/lib/concepts/`, `src/lib/examples/`) and cross-tool interaction memory (`ToyTools.prefs`).
- Full guides, FAQs, and knowledge-graph entries for all five finance tools.
- Content Intelligence and Research Intelligence integration for the finance ecosystem, plus an evidence-backed expansion roadmap (`docs/finance-roadmap.md`).
